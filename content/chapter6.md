# Chapter 6: Traffic Safety

**Crash Analysis and Countermeasures**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, it should be possible to:

- **Remember:** define crash rate, severity index, and safety performance functions.
- **Understand:** explain the three E's of safety (Engineering, Education, Enforcement).
- **Apply:** calculate crash rates and identify hazardous locations.
- **Analyze:** evaluate countermeasure effectiveness using CMFs.

## 6.1 Introduction to Traffic Safety

Traffic safety is a primary goal of transportation engineering. This chapter covers methods for analyzing crashes, identifying hazardous locations, and selecting effective countermeasures.

## 6.2 Crash Data Analysis

*Required Bloom level: Apply*

Crash data is analyzed to identify patterns and trends. Key metrics include crash frequency, crash rate (per million vehicle-miles), and crash severity (fatal, injury, property damage only).

## 6.3 Identifying Hazardous Locations

*Required Bloom level: Analyze*

Methods for identifying hazardous locations include: crash frequency ranking, crash rate methods, and statistical methods (e.g., potential for safety improvement).

## 6.4 Countermeasures

*Required Bloom level: Understand*

Safety countermeasures address specific crash types. The Highway Safety Manual provides Crash Modification Factors (CMFs) to predict the effectiveness of various countermeasures.

## 6.5 Road Safety Audits

*Required Bloom level: Understand*

A Road Safety Audit is a formal examination of an existing or future road by an independent team to identify safety issues and suggest countermeasures.
