# Chapter 2: Transportation Agencies in Saudi Arabia

**Understanding the System by Function**

Instructor: Dr. Fahad Alqahtani

> **Note:** Quiz 1 covers Chapters 1 & 2

Transportation engineering is not only about designing roads, railways, airports, and ports. It is also about understanding the public system that plans these networks, sets the rules for using them, funds and delivers projects, enforces safe behavior, and learns from failures. This chapter explains that system in Saudi Arabia in a practical way: by focusing on the **functions** that any transport system must perform, and then identifying the entities that carry those functions. When you think in terms of functions, the system becomes easier to understand because each agency has a purpose, a set of decisions it controls, and a clear role in the life cycle of transport projects and operations.

A transport system needs multiple functions because transport is high-risk, technically complex, and affects the whole economy. One entity cannot do everything well without creating overload or conflicts of interest. For example, the organization that delivers infrastructure should not be the same organization that independently investigates major accidents, and the organization that enforces traffic laws is not the same organization that regulates transport services. In addition, each mode—roads, public transport, aviation, maritime, rail—has distinct technical standards and operational risks. For these reasons, Saudi Arabia uses specialized entities, each responsible for a specific function.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, it should be possible to:

- **Remember:** name key entities and identify their main function.
- **Understand:** explain the purpose of each function (policy, regulation, infrastructure responsibility, standards, investigation, enforcement, integration).
- **Apply:** for a short scenario, identify which entities should be involved and what each contributes.

## Key Vocabulary

- **Policy / strategy:** national direction and priorities (what the country wants the transport system to achieve).
- **Regulation:** rule-setting and oversight for a sector (who is allowed to operate, requirements, licensing, compliance).
- **Infrastructure responsibility:** long-term care of networks and terminals (planning programs, maintenance, upgrades, performance).
- **Technical standards:** design and operating requirements that create consistent, predictable outcomes.
- **Safety oversight:** audits, inspections, compliance monitoring, and safety performance management.
- **Independent safety investigation:** root-cause analysis of major accidents to produce recommendations and system learning (not enforcement).
- **Enforcement:** applying laws and penalties to influence user behavior (drivers, vehicle owners, and road users).
- **Integration:** making multiple modes and entities work together as one system (especially in major cities and peak seasons).

## 1) National policy, strategy, and system leadership

*Required Bloom level for this section: Understand*

Every country needs a central function that sets national direction: long-term transport priorities, network integration, logistics objectives, and cross-sector coordination. This function ensures that transport aligns with national development goals and that different modes work together rather than compete, duplicate, or leave gaps.

In Saudi Arabia, this leadership role sits with the **Ministry of Transport and Logistics Services (وزارة النقل والخدمات اللوجستية)**.

Website: https://mot.gov.sa/en/home

The ministry's role is not to manage every project detail directly; it steers the overall system by defining priorities, coordinating national programs, and driving integration across modes so the transport and logistics sector advances as a coherent whole.

**What this function does (typical responsibilities):**

- Sets sector direction and high-level priorities.
- Coordinates cross-mode programs (roads, logistics, aviation, rail, ports) so they align.
- Enables system-level integration and strategic transformation.

**What this function does not do:**

- It is not the day-to-day regulator of individual service providers.
- It is not traffic enforcement.
- It is not independent accident investigation.
- It is not the detailed designer for every road or intersection.

> **Example**
> 
> A national goal to improve network quality or logistics performance is set at this level, but the delivery of projects and services is carried by specialized entities in each mode.

## 2) Regulation and market governance

*Required Bloom level for this section: Understand → Apply*

A transport system needs rules. Regulation is the function that controls who is allowed to provide transport services, what requirements those services must meet, and how users and operators are protected. Regulation prevents disorder in the market: unlicensed operators, unsafe services, and inconsistent service quality. For engineers, regulation matters because it creates the boundaries within which design and operations must work.

### 2.1 Transport General Authority (TGA) — land, rail, and maritime regulation

**الهيئة العامة للنقل**

Website: https://www.tga.gov.sa/en

The **Transport General Authority (TGA)** is the regulator for **land transport, rail transport, and maritime transport** as service sectors. This includes licensing and oversight of service providers and setting regulatory frameworks that shape how services operate and how quality and safety are maintained.

**What TGA does:**

- Licenses regulated transport activities in land/rail/maritime sectors.
- Sets compliance requirements and monitors service quality/safety for regulated activities.
- Issues regulatory frameworks that affect how transport services are provided.

**What TGA does not do:**

- It is not traffic enforcement on streets.
- It is not the owner/operator of the national road network.
- It is not the independent investigator of major accidents.

> **Example**
> 
> If a company wants to legally operate a regulated transport service, the permission-to-operate and requirements function belongs to the regulator, even though vehicles physically operate on roads managed by other entities.

### 2.2 General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) — aviation regulation

**الهيئة العامة للطيران المدني**

Website: https://gaca.gov.sa/en

The **General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA)** regulates the aviation sector. Aviation is treated as a separate regulatory domain because it is highly technical and safety-critical and requires deep expertise and alignment with international aviation standards and practices.

**What GACA does:**

- Provides aviation regulations and oversight.
- Manages licensing and regulatory requirements for aviation activities.
- Ensures compliance with aviation safety and operational requirements.

**What GACA does not do:**

- It does not regulate land/rail/maritime services (that is handled in the land/rail/maritime regulatory domain).
- It does not enforce road traffic laws.

> **Example**
> 
> If an airline or airport activity requires authorization, the rules and approvals are handled under aviation regulation rather than under land transport regulation.

## 3) Infrastructure governance and long-term infrastructure responsibility (by mode)

*Required Bloom level for this section: Understand → Apply*

A transport system also needs organizations that take responsibility for infrastructure: networks and terminals that must be planned, developed, maintained, and improved. This function is about assets and long-term performance: condition, capacity, resilience, and reliability. This is where capital programs and maintenance programs live.

### 3.1 Roads — Roads General Authority (RGA)

**الهيئة العامة للطرق**

Website: https://www.rga.gov.sa

In the road sector, the **Roads General Authority (RGA)** has a sector-level role that supports a unified road system, including consistent practices and performance expectations across the road sector.

**What RGA does (road sector role):**

- Supports road-sector governance and unified approaches across the road system.
- Promotes consistent practices and performance expectations for road infrastructure.

**What RGA does not do:**

- It is not traffic enforcement.
- It is not independent accident investigation.
- It is not the operator of public transport services.

### 3.2 Ports — Saudi Ports Authority (MAWANI)

**الهيئة العامة للموانئ (موانئ)**

Website: https://mawani.gov.sa

Ports are complex systems where infrastructure, safety, capacity, and logistics performance must work together. **MAWANI** leads the development and management of ports within its scope, focusing on port performance and long-term port capability.

**What MAWANI does:**

- Develops and manages port infrastructure and port facilities within its scope.
- Improves port capacity, efficiency, and overall port performance.
- Acts as a key "owner/client" function for port development programs.

### 3.3 Rail — Saudi Arabia Railways (SAR)

**الخطوط الحديدية السعودية**

Website: https://sar.com.sa

Rail requires integrated management because track, rolling stock, signaling, operations, and maintenance must function as one coherent system. **Saudi Arabia Railways (SAR)** is central to intercity rail infrastructure and operations.

**What SAR does:**

- Operates passenger and freight rail services and manages key rail assets within its network.
- Plans, maintains, and improves rail infrastructure and supporting facilities as part of rail system performance.

### 3.4 Airports — MATARAT Holding ecosystem

**شركة مطارات القابضة**

Website: https://matarat.com.sa

Airport infrastructure and operational management is carried through the aviation ecosystem, including airport operating companies and the transformation platform led by **MATARAT Holding**.

## 4) Technical standards and consistent engineering practice

*Required Bloom level for this section: Understand → Apply*

A transport system needs technical requirements that translate safety and performance expectations into consistent engineering decisions. Technical standards exist because designs must be consistent across projects to produce predictable outcomes and reduce avoidable risk.

In Saudi Arabia, technical requirements are especially visible in the road sector through road-sector frameworks and unified practices supported by the **Roads General Authority**. Regulators also embed technical compliance requirements into licensing and oversight processes, particularly in highly technical domains such as aviation.

## 5) Safety oversight versus independent safety investigation

*Required Bloom level for this section: Understand → Apply*

Safety is addressed through more than one function.

**Safety oversight** exists inside regulators and infrastructure owners. It includes safety requirements, audits, inspections, compliance monitoring, and safety performance management. Oversight is continuous and preventive.

**Independent safety investigation** exists to learn from major incidents and produce recommendations based on technical findings. This function focuses on system learning rather than penalties.

In Saudi Arabia, independent investigation is carried out by the **National Transport Safety Center (NTSC) — المركز الوطني لسلامة النقل**.

Website: https://ntsc.gov.sa/en

## 6) Traffic enforcement and user-side compliance

*Required Bloom level for this section: Remember → Understand → Apply*

Transport safety also depends on day-to-day user compliance. This function enforces traffic laws, manages traffic procedures, and applies penalties to influence behavior.

In Saudi Arabia, this function is carried by **Traffic (المرور)** within the **Ministry of Interior (وزارة الداخلية)**.

Website: https://www.moi.gov.sa

## 7) Local and regional transport integration (cities and special zones)

*Required Bloom level for this section: Understand → Apply*

Large urban areas and special zones require a function that integrates modes locally: network integration, operational coordination, public transport planning integration, and management of peak demands.

### 7.1 Riyadh — Royal Commission for Riyadh City (RCRC)
