# Chapter 5: Highway Design Standards

**Geometric Design and Design Controls**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, it should be possible to:

- **Remember:** list key design elements (lane width, shoulder, cross slope, etc.).
- **Understand:** explain how design speed controls geometric design.
- **Apply:** calculate horizontal and vertical curve parameters.
- **Analyze:** evaluate design alternatives for safety and operations.

## 5.1 Introduction to Geometric Design

Geometric design establishes the visible dimensions of the highway, including horizontal alignment, vertical alignment, and cross-section elements. Design is based on design speed, design vehicle, and design traffic volume.

## 5.2 Design Controls

*Required Bloom level: Understand*

Design speed is the most important control—it determines minimum curve radii, sight distances, and superelevation rates. The selected design speed should reflect the character of the terrain and the expected operating speed.

## 5.3 Horizontal Alignment

*Required Bloom level: Apply*

Horizontal alignment consists of tangents (straight sections) connected by circular curves and transition (spiral) curves. Key elements include curve radius, superelevation, and side friction.

## 5.4 Vertical Alignment

*Required Bloom level: Apply*

Vertical alignment consists of grades connected by vertical curves (crest or sag). Design ensures adequate sight distance over crests and proper drainage and headlight sight distance in sags.

## 5.5 Cross-Section Elements

*Required Bloom level: Remember*

Cross-section elements include: travel lanes, shoulders, medians, side slopes, drainage features, and clear zones. Standard widths are specified in design manuals based on design speed and traffic volume.
