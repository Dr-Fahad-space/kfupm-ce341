# Chapter 4: Traffic Engineering Studies

**Speed, Volume, and Traffic Flow Analysis**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, it should be possible to:

- **Remember:** define traffic volume, density, speed, and headway.
- **Understand:** explain the relationship between volume, speed, and density (fundamental diagram).
- **Apply:** conduct speed studies and volume counts using appropriate methods.
- **Analyze:** interpret traffic data and identify operational issues.

## Key Vocabulary

- **Traffic Volume:** number of vehicles passing a point during a time interval.
- **Density (k):** number of vehicles per unit length of roadway.
- **Speed (u):** distance traveled per unit time.
- **Headway:** time between successive vehicles passing a point.
- **Spacing:** distance between successive vehicles.
- **Flow (q):** equivalent to volume, vehicles per hour.

## 4.1 Introduction

Traffic engineering studies provide the data needed for design, operation, and management of transportation facilities. This chapter covers the fundamental traffic stream parameters and methods for collecting and analyzing traffic data.

## 4.2 Speed Studies

*Required Bloom level: Apply*

Speed studies measure how fast vehicles are traveling. Types include spot speed studies (at a point) and travel time studies (over a section). Key statistics include average speed, 85th percentile speed, and pace.

## 4.3 Volume Studies

*Required Bloom level: Apply*

Volume studies count the number of vehicles at a location. Methods include manual counts, pneumatic tubes, inductive loops, and video detection. Volume varies by time of day, day of week, and season.

## 4.4 Fundamental Traffic Flow Theory

*Required Bloom level: Understand + Analyze*

The fundamental relationship **q = k × u** relates flow (q), density (k), and speed (u). The fundamental diagram shows how these variables interact, revealing capacity and congested conditions.

## Sample Questions

### Q1 — Bloom's Level: Remember

**Question:** Define traffic density.

**Answer:** The number of vehicles occupying a unit length of roadway, typically expressed in vehicles per kilometer or vehicles per mile.

### Q2 — Bloom's Level: Apply

**Question:** If the volume is 1200 veh/h and the average speed is 60 km/h, what is the density?

**Answer:** k = q/u = 1200/60 = **20 veh/km**
