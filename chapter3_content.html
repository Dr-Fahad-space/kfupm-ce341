    <h2>Chapter Introduction</h2>
    <p>Highway transportation systems look simple on the surface—people drive along roads in vehicles—but the system's performance and safety depend on several interacting components. This chapter organizes the highway mode of transportation into four core components: <b>the driver</b>, <b>the pedestrian</b>, <b>the vehicle</b>, and <b>the road</b>.</p>

    <p>A key theme is <b>variability</b>. Drivers differ in perception, decision-making, and reaction. Pedestrians vary in walking speed and attention. Vehicles vary in size, weight, acceleration, and braking. Roads vary in alignment, grade, surface condition, and sight distance. Because traffic engineering is not an exact science, design commonly uses <b>percentile-based criteria</b> (for example, 85th or 95th percentile capabilities) to cover most users under most conditions.</p>

    <h3>3.1 Introduction: Four components of the highway system</h3>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Remember + Understand</span>

    <p>The highway transportation system consists of four interacting components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Driver:</b> perceives information (signs, vehicles, pedestrians), makes decisions, and executes control (steer, brake, accelerate).</li>
        <li><b>Pedestrian:</b> shares space at crossings and along road edges; has different speed, perception, and vulnerability than vehicle users.</li>
        <li><b>Vehicle:</b> provides mobility but imposes geometric and physical constraints (size, turning path, acceleration and braking limits).</li>
        <li><b>Road:</b> the infrastructure that must provide adequate geometry, surface condition, and sight distance for expected operating speeds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2 Driver characteristics</h3>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Understand</span>

    <p>Driver skill and perceptual abilities (seeing, hearing, evaluating, and reacting) vary widely and can degrade with alcohol, fatigue, medication side effects, or time of day. For design, engineers typically select criteria aligned with a high percentile capability (often the 85th or 95th percentile).</p>

    <h4>3.2.1 Visual reception</h4>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Understand + Apply</span>

    <p>Vision is the primary sensory input for driving. Important eye characteristics include <b>visual acuity</b>, <b>peripheral vision</b>, <b>color vision</b>, <b>glare vision and recovery</b>, and <b>depth perception</b>. Visual acuity is commonly described using Snellen fractions.</p>

    [FIGURE: Visual field diagram showing central vision cone, peripheral vision range, and how it narrows with speed]

    <p>Peripheral vision allows a driver to detect objects outside the narrow cone of clearest vision. The peripheral cone can be very wide (up to about 160°) but effectively narrows as speed increases.</p>

    [TABLE: Summary of visual reception characteristics and their design implications]

    <h4>3.2.2 Hearing reception</h4>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Understand</span>
    <p>Hearing is typically secondary for driving tasks, but it matters for detecting warning sounds (especially from emergency vehicles).</p>

    <h4>3.2.3 Perception–reaction (PIEV) process</h4>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Understand + Apply</span>

    <p>The response to a roadway stimulus can be divided into four sub-processes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Perception:</b> noticing the object/control device</li>
        <li><b>Identification:</b> recognizing what it is</li>
        <li><b>Emotion (decision):</b> choosing an action</li>
        <li><b>Volition / reaction:</b> executing the action</li>
    </ol>

    [FIGURE: PIEV process flowchart showing the four stages with time progression]

    <p>The total time is commonly called <b>perception–reaction time</b>. Typical values range from about <b>1.2 to 3.0 s</b>, and design often uses <b>2.5 s</b>.</p>

    <h4>3.2.4 Older drivers</h4>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Understand</span>
    <p>Older drivers may experience slower information processing, slower reaction time, and reduced visual and hearing capability.</p>

    <div class="key-vocabulary">
        <h4>Key Vocabulary - Driver Characteristics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Visual acuity:</b> ability to see fine detail; commonly described using the Snellen fraction (e.g., 6/6).</li>
            <li><b>Peripheral vision:</b> ability to detect objects outside the cone of clearest vision; generally narrows as speed increases.</li>
            <li><b>PIEV / perception–reaction process:</b> Perception, Identification, Emotion, Volition—the sub-processes that determine response time.</li>
            <li><b>Perception–reaction time (t):</b> elapsed time from noticing a stimulus to completing the initial response.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3.3 Pedestrian characteristics</h3>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Understand + Apply</span>

    <p>Pedestrians share many relevant characteristics with drivers (vision and hearing), but their <b>walking behavior</b> is additionally critical for traffic control design.</p>

    <p>A commonly used walking speed from the Highway Capacity Manual is about <b>1.22 m/s</b>, and it is often reduced to about <b>0.9 m/s</b> when the proportion of elderly pedestrians exceeds approximately 20%.</p>

    [IMAGE: Photo of pedestrians at a crosswalk showing different walking speeds]

    <div class="key-vocabulary">
        <h4>Key Vocabulary - Pedestrian Characteristics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Walking speed:</b> typical design value of 1.22 m/s; reduced to 0.9 m/s for areas with >20% elderly pedestrians.</li>
            <li><b>Pedestrian clearance time:</b> time required for a pedestrian to cross a street.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3.4 Vehicle characteristics</h3>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Analyze</span>

    <p>Vehicle characteristics are organized into: <b>static</b> (size and weight), <b>kinematic</b> (speed/acceleration/distance), and <b>dynamic</b> (forces).</p>

    [FIGURE: Classification diagram showing static, kinematic, and dynamic vehicle characteristics]

    <h4>3.4.1 Static characteristics: size and weight</h4>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Analyze</span>

    <p>The size of the design vehicle affects lane width, shoulder width, parking bay dimensions, and vertical curve length. Vehicle axle loads influence pavement thickness.</p>

    [FIGURE: Design vehicle turning path templates showing minimum turning radii for different vehicle types]

    [TABLE: AASHTO design vehicle dimensions and key characteristics]

    <h4>3.4.2 Kinematic characteristics: acceleration as a function of speed</h4>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Apply</span>

    <p>A common model relates acceleration to current speed: <b>du/dt = α − βu</b></p>

    [FIGURE: Graph showing acceleration vs. speed curve for typical passenger car and truck]

    <h4>3.4.3 Dynamic characteristics: resistances, power, braking, and curve design</h4>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Apply + Evaluate</span>

    <p>Resistive forces include: air resistance, grade resistance, rolling resistance, and curve resistance.</p>

    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Apply</span>

    [FIGURE: Diagram illustrating braking distance scenario with perception-reaction distance and actual braking distance]

    <h4>3.4.5 Minimum radius of a circular curve</h4>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Apply</span>

    <p>Curve design balances lateral acceleration using superelevation and side friction.</p>

    <div class="key-vocabulary">
        <h4>Key Vocabulary - Vehicle Characteristics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Design vehicle:</b> representative vehicle selected to control key geometric design dimensions.</li>
            <li><b>Static vehicle characteristics:</b> size and weight properties (length, width, axle loads).</li>
            <li><b>Kinematic vehicle characteristics:</b> motion relationships (speed, acceleration, distance).</li>
            <li><b>Dynamic vehicle characteristics:</b> forces that cause/oppose motion.</li>
            <li><b>Braking distance (D<sub>b</sub>):</b> distance required to decelerate under specified deceleration and grade.</li>
            <li><b>Superelevation (e):</b> roadway cross-slope on a curve.</li>
            <li><b>Side friction factor (f<sub>s</sub>):</b> lateral tire–pavement friction.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3.5 Road characteristics: sight distance</h3>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Understand + Apply</span>

    <p><b>Sight distance</b> is the length of roadway a driver can see ahead. Two major types are: <b>Stopping sight distance (SSD)</b> and <b>Passing sight distance (PSD)</b>.</p>

    [FIGURE: Profile diagram showing sight distance measurement on vertical and horizontal curves]

    <h4>3.5.1 Stopping sight distance (SSD)</h4>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Apply</span>

    <p>SSD is the sum of: (1) distance traveled during perception–reaction time, and (2) braking distance.</p>

    [FIGURE: SSD diagram showing perception-reaction distance + braking distance components]
    [TABLE: SSD values for various design speeds and conditions]

    <h4>3.5.2 Passing sight distance (PSD)</h4>
    <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level: Understand</span>

    <p>PSD is the minimum sight distance required on a two-lane, two-way highway to allow a driver to complete a passing maneuver safely.</p>

    [FIGURE: PSD diagram showing passing vehicle, passed vehicle, and opposing vehicle positions]
    [IMAGE: Photo of a passing zone on a two-lane highway]

    <div class="key-vocabulary">
        <h4>Key Vocabulary - Road Characteristics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Stopping sight distance (SSD):</b> minimum distance needed for a driver to perceive an object and stop.</li>
            <li><b>Passing sight distance (PSD):</b> minimum distance needed to complete a passing maneuver on a two-lane road.</li>
        </ul>
