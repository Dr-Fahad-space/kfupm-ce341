                <p class="text-body">
                    Transportation engineering is a branch of civil engineering focused on the planning, design, operation, and maintenance of systems that move people and goods safely, efficiently, and sustainably. These systems include roads and highways, railways, airports, ports, and public transportation systems, along with the vehicles and users that operate within them.
                </p>
                <p class="text-body">
                    At its core, transportation engineering is about <strong>mobility</strong>—the ability to move from one place to another—and <strong>accessibility</strong>—the ability to reach desired destinations such as homes, workplaces, schools, hospitals, and markets. A system with high mobility but poor accessibility (for example, a fast highway that does not connect to key destinations) is not successful; strong systems balance both.
                </p>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Transportation engineering differs from many other civil engineering areas because it deals heavily with human behavior and real-time interactions between users, vehicles, and infrastructure. Transportation systems are dynamic: performance changes with demand, weather, incidents, and human decisions.

                <h3 class="section-title">1.1 What is Transportation Engineering?</h3>
                <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Understand</span>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Transportation engineering focuses on moving people and goods safely, efficiently, and sustainably through planning, design, operation, and maintenance of transportation systems. These systems include roadways, railways, airports, ports, and public transportation networks.
                </p>
                <p class="text-body">
                    A central idea is the balance between mobility and accessibility. Mobility alone is not enough; a fast facility that does not connect to useful destinations does not serve the system purpose. Accessibility ensures the network connects people and goods to the places that matter.
                </p>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Transportation engineering also requires strong attention to human factors. Unlike many civil systems that behave predictably under physical laws alone, transportation performance depends on user decisions and interactions, which vary by time and situation.
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-title">1.2 Why Transportation Engineering Matters</h3>
                <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Understand</span>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Transportation systems are essential to economic development, public safety, and quality of life. Nearly every economic activity depends on reliable transportation, and poor systems increase travel time, fuel consumption, crashes, and environmental impacts.
                </p>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Transportation engineering directly affects society through:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> traffic crashes are a major cause of death and injury.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equity:</strong> access to transportation affects who can reach jobs and services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> transportation is a major contributor to energy use and emissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urban form:</strong> cities grow and develop around transportation networks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Because transportation facilities are used daily by large populations, design and operational decisions create long-lasting impacts.
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-title">1.3 What is a Transportation System?</h3>
                <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Remember → Understand → Apply</span>
                <p class="text-body">
                    A transportation system is an organized combination of components that work together to enable movement. The components can be grouped into four categories: users, vehicles, infrastructure, and control/management.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">1.3.1 Users</h4>
                <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this subsection: Understand</span>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Users include drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists. Human behavior is central because reaction time, perception, judgment, and decision-making directly influence performance and safety.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <span class="box-title">Example: User behavior and safety</span>
                    <p class="text-body">
                        A driver approaching an intersection must perceive a yellow signal, decide whether to stop or proceed, and execute that decision. If the signal timing does not account for realistic perception-reaction time, the driver may be forced into an unsafe choice, increasing crash risk.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">1.3.2 Vehicles</h4>
                <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this subsection: Understand</span>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Vehicles include cars, trucks, buses, trains, and aircraft. They differ in size/weight, speed/acceleration, maneuverability, and operating characteristics, and these differences strongly affect design, capacity, and safety.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <span class="box-title">Example: Vehicle characteristics and design</span>
                    <p class="text-body">
                        A large truck requires wider turning radii and longer stopping distances than a passenger car. Intersection design must accommodate the largest vehicles expected to use the facility, or restrictions must be clearly posted and enforced.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">1.3.3 Infrastructure</h4>
                <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this subsection: Remember → Understand</span>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Infrastructure includes roads and highways, intersections and interchanges, bridges and tunnels, rail tracks, airports, and ports. Engineers design infrastructure to accommodate expected demand while meeting safety and performance standards.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">1.3.4 Control and Management</h4>
                <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this subsection: Understand → Apply</span>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Control and management include devices and policies that regulate and organize movement: traffic signals, signs, pavement markings, speed limits, enforcement, and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). ITS uses sensors, communications, and computing to support monitoring and management of transportation systems in real time. These tools reduce conflicts and support orderly operation.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">

                    <p class="text-body">
                        At a busy intersection, a traffic signal organizes conflicting movements by assigning right-of-way in sequence. Without the signal, drivers would need to negotiate right-of-way individually, increasing delay and crash risk significantly.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="section-title">1.4 Modes of Transportation</h3>
                <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Remember → Understand</span>
                <p class="text-body">
                    A mode of transportation is the type of system used to move people or goods. Major modes include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Highway (Road) transportation:</strong> flexible and widely used; includes private vehicles, buses, and trucks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rail transportation:</strong> efficient for high-capacity passenger or freight movement over fixed routes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air transportation:</strong> fastest for long-distance passenger and high-value freight movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maritime transportation:</strong> essential for international trade and bulk goods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public transportation:</strong> buses, metros, and light rail designed to move large numbers efficiently.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Each mode has advantages and limitations. Transportation engineering often involves selecting an appropriate mode or integrating modes into a multimodal transportation system.
                </p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <span class="box-title">Example: Multimodal integration</span>
                    <p class="text-body">
                        A commuter may drive to a park-and-ride facility, take a metro to the city center, and walk to their workplace. The success of this trip depends on coordination between road access, parking availability, metro frequency, and pedestrian infrastructure—illustrating the importance of multimodal planning.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="section-title">1.5 Transportation Engineering vs. Traffic Engineering</h3>
                <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Understand → Apply</span>
                <p class="text-body">
                    Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they differ:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transportation engineering</strong> is broad: planning, design, operation, and policy across all modes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traffic engineering</strong> is narrower: movement of vehicles and pedestrians on roadways, including traffic flow, intersections, signals, and safety.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-body">
                    A highway corridor study, intersection signal timing, or crash pattern analysis is typically traffic engineering; a citywide public transport plan, corridor investment evaluation, or multimodal network design is transportation engineering.
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-title">1.6 The Transportation Engineering Process</h3>

                <p class="text-body">
                    Transportation engineers work in government agencies, consulting firms, construction companies, research institutions, and planning organizations. They use design manuals (e.g., AASHTO), data analysis, software tools, and professional judgment to make decisions affecting safety and mobility.

                <p class="text-body">
                    Ethics and responsibility are especially important because design errors or poor decisions can directly result in injuries, fatalities, or major economic losses.
