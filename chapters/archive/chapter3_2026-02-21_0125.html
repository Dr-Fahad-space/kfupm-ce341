        Highway transportation systems look simple on the surface-people drive along roads in vehicles-but the system's
        performance and safety depend on several interacting components. This chapter organizes the highway mode of
        transportation into four core components: <b>the driver</b>, <b>the pedestrian</b>, <b>the vehicle</b>, and <b>the road</b>.
        A practical engineer must understand both the capabilities and the limitations of each component, because design
        decisions (geometry, control devices, and operating policies) must be compatible with real users and real vehicles.
      </p>

      <p class="text-body">
        A key theme is <b>variability</b>. Drivers differ in perception, decision-making, and reaction. Pedestrians vary in walking speed
        and attention. Vehicles vary in size, weight, acceleration, and braking. Roads vary in alignment, grade, surface condition,
        and sight distance. Because traffic engineering is not an exact science, design commonly uses <b>percentile-based criteria</b>
        (for example, 85th or 95th percentile capabilities) to cover most users under most conditions.

      <h4 class="subsection-title">3.1.1 Design Philosophy: Designing for a Range of Users</h4>
      <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this subsection: Understand + Analyze</span>

      <p class="text-body">
        Highway facilities serve a remarkably diverse population. Drivers range from teenagers to elderly individuals with declining sensory abilities. 
        Vehicles range from compact cars to 22-metre articulated trucks. Pedestrians include fit adults, mobility-impaired individuals, and wheelchair users. 
        Designing for the "average" member would leave many users inadequately served—an average reaction time means half of all drivers react more slowly, 
        which is dangerous when the consequence is a collision.
      </p>

      <p class="text-body">
        For this reason, engineers use <b>percentile-based design criteria</b>. A design based on the 85th-percentile accommodates 85% of users; 
        one based on the 95th-percentile accommodates 95%. The choice reflects engineering judgment balancing safety against cost:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>85th percentile:</b> Used for operational parameters like operating speed where consequences are manageable</li>
        <li><b>95th percentile:</b> Reserved for safety-critical parameters where non-accommodation is life-threatening (e.g., stopping sight distance)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <span class="box-title">Design Example: Perception-Reaction Time Selection</span>
        <p class="text-body">
          AASHTO recommends a design PRT of <b>2.5 seconds</b> for stopping sight distance calculations. This value encompasses approximately 
          <b>90% of drivers</b> under most conditions—a deliberate choice exceeding the 85th percentile because the consequence of insufficient 
          reaction time is a potential crash.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-body">
        When stakes are higher—complex interchanges, school zones, or facilities serving predominantly elderly populations—engineers should 
        consider using higher percentiles or supplementary safety measures. Percentile-based design is not arbitrary conservatism; it is a 
        rational, quantitative method for managing inherent variability in human performance.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subsection-title">3.1.2 The Four Components</h4>
      <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this subsection: Remember</span>

      <p class="text-body">
        The highway transportation system consists of four interacting components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Driver:</b> perceives information (signs, vehicles, pedestrians), makes decisions, and executes control (steer, brake, accelerate).</li>
        <li><b>Pedestrian:</b> shares space at crossings and along road edges; has different speed, perception, and vulnerability than vehicle users.</li>
        <li><b>Vehicle:</b> provides mobility but imposes geometric and physical constraints (size, turning path, acceleration and braking limits).</li>
        <li><b>Road:</b> the infrastructure that must provide adequate geometry, surface condition, and sight distance for expected operating speeds.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-body">
        Safe and efficient operation requires that design and control account for limitations in each component, especially under
        common adverse conditions such as nighttime driving, rain, fatigue, distraction, or mixed traffic (trucks, buses, cars, and pedestrians).

          You should now be able to explain why percentile-based design criteria are used instead of averages, identify typical percentiles 
          (85th and 95th) employed in highway design, and list the four components of the highway transportation system (driver, pedestrian, 
          vehicle, and road) and their key interactions.

          <b>Visual acuity:</b> Ability to resolve fine details; measured by Snellen chart (e.g., 6/6 vision).<br>
          <b>Peripheral vision:</b> Ability to detect objects outside central vision; up to 160° but narrows with speed.<br>

        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-body">
        Driver skill and perceptual abilities (seeing, hearing, evaluating, and reacting) vary widely and can degrade with alcohol,
        fatigue, medication side effects, or time of day. For design, engineers typically select criteria aligned with a high percentile
        capability (often the 85th or 95th percentile) to cover a broad portion of the driver population.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subsection-title">3.2.1 Visual reception</h4>
      <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Understand + Apply</span>

      <p class="text-body">
        Vision is the primary sensory input for driving. Important eye characteristics include <b>visual acuity</b>, <b>peripheral vision</b>,
        <b>color vision</b>, <b>glare vision and recovery</b>, and <b>depth perception</b>. Visual acuity is commonly described using Snellen fractions.
        For example, a person with 6/15 vision sees at 6 meters what a "normal" 6/6 observer can see at 15 meters.
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <span class="box-title">Example: Visual acuity and sign legibility distance (Snellen relationship)</span>
        <p class="text-body">
          A driver with visual acuity <b>6/10</b> can just decipher a sign at <b>6 m</b> from the sign. The equivalent "normal vision" distance is:<br>
          <b>d(6/6) = (10/6) × 6 = 10 m</b>.<br><br>
          Using this as the reference distance for the same sign:
          <ul>
            <li><b>6/4:</b> d = (6/4) × 10 = <b>15 m</b></li>
            <li><b>6/15:</b> d = (6/15) × 10 = <b>4 m</b></li>
          </ul>
          The lesson for design is that reduced acuity can sharply reduce the distance available for recognition and decision-making.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-body">
        Peripheral vision allows a driver to detect objects outside the narrow cone of clearest vision. The peripheral cone can be
        very wide (up to about 160°) but effectively narrows as speed increases-drivers at higher speeds "see" less to the side,
        which supports the need for clear guidance and simplified decision points on high-speed facilities.
      </p>

      <p class="text-body">
        Color vision supports recognition of colored control devices (signals, signs, pavement markings). Glare vision and recovery
        become important with oncoming headlights and sudden changes from dark to bright environments. Depth perception affects
        the ability to judge speed and distance-critical during passing maneuvers on two-lane roads.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subsection-title">3.2.2 Hearing reception</h4>
      <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Understand</span>

      <p class="text-body">
        Hearing is typically secondary for driving tasks, but it matters for detecting warning sounds (especially from emergency vehicles).
        Mild hearing loss is often correctable, so it is usually less critical than vision in geometric design, but it remains relevant in the
        overall human factors context.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subsection-title">3.2.3 Perception-reaction (PIEV) process</h4>
      <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Understand + Apply</span>

      <p class="text-body">
        The response to a roadway stimulus (for a driver, cyclist, or pedestrian) can be divided into four sub-processes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Perception:</b> noticing the object/control device (e.g., a hazard, a sign, a signal).</li>
        <li><b>Identification:</b> recognizing what it is and understanding the stimulus.</li>
        <li><b>Emotion (decision):</b> choosing an action (brake, change lanes, pass, etc.).</li>
        <li><b>Volition / reaction:</b> executing the action (initial control input).</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text-body">
        The total time from perception start to reaction completion is commonly called <b>perception-reaction time</b>. It varies substantially;
        typical values range from about <b>1.2 to 3.0 s</b>, and design often uses <b>2.5 s</b> (a common high-percentile assumption). This time is a
        fundamental input for <b>minimum sight distance</b>, <b>braking distance</b>, and even <b>signal timing</b> (e.g., amber interval).
      </p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <span class="box-title">Example 3.1 — Distance Travelled During Perception-Reaction Time</span>
        <p class="text-body">
          A driver with a PRT of 2.5 s is travelling at 105 km/h when she observes an incident blocking the road ahead. 
          Determine the distance the vehicle travels before the driver activates the brakes.
          <br><br>
          <b>Solution:</b>
          <br>Step 1: Convert speed to m/s: u = 105 × (1000/3600) = 29.17 m/s
          <br>Step 2: Distance during PRT: d = u × t = 29.17 × 2.5 = <b>72.9 m</b>
          <br><br>
          <i>Insight:</i> At highway speeds, the vehicle travels nearly 73 m before any braking force is applied. 
          This distance alone is substantial and underscores why PRT is so critical to design.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4 class="subsection-title">3.2.4 Older drivers</h4>
      <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Understand</span>

      <p class="text-body">
        The proportion of older drivers (typically aged 65+) has grown dramatically. Aging systematically degrades sensory, cognitive, 
        and physical capabilities that driving demands. Specific declining abilities include:

        Highway geometric design is partly based on vehicle characteristics. For engineering purposes, vehicle characteristics are often organized into:
        <b>static</b> (size and weight), <b>kinematic</b> (speed/acceleration/distance relationships), and <b>dynamic</b> (forces causing or opposing motion).

        AASHTO groups vehicles into broad classes (passenger cars, trucks, buses, recreational vehicles). Within each class, the engineer may

        Low-speed turning performance is primarily controlled by vehicle size. Trucks and buses typically require larger turning radii than passenger cars,
