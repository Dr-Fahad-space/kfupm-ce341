      <h2 class="chapter-subtitle">Transportation Agencies in Saudi Arabia — Understanding the System by Function</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="chapter-content">
      <p class="text-body">
        Transportation engineering is not only about designing roads, railways, airports, and ports. It is also about
        understanding the public system that plans these networks, sets the rules for using them, funds and delivers
        projects, enforces safe behavior, and learns from failures. This chapter explains that system in Saudi Arabia in
        a practical way: by focusing on the <b>functions</b> that any transport system must perform, and then
        identifying the entities that carry those functions. When you think in terms of functions, the system becomes
        easier to understand because each agency has a purpose, a set of decisions it controls, and a clear role in the
        life cycle of transport projects and operations.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        A transport system needs multiple functions because transport is high-risk, technically complex, and affects the
        whole economy. One entity cannot do everything well without creating overload or conflicts of interest. For
        example, the organization that delivers infrastructure should not be the same organization that independently
        investigates major accidents, and the organization that enforces traffic laws is not the same organization that
        regulates transport services. In addition, each mode—roads, public transport, aviation, maritime, rail—has
        distinct technical standards and operational risks. For these reasons, Saudi Arabia uses specialized entities,
        each responsible for a specific function.

      <h3 class="section-title">1) National policy, strategy, and system leadership</h3>
      <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Understand</span>

      <p class="text-body">
        Every country needs a central function that sets national direction: long-term transport priorities, network
        integration, logistics objectives, and cross-sector coordination. This function ensures that transport aligns
        with national development goals and that different modes work together rather than compete, duplicate, or leave
        gaps.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        In Saudi Arabia, this leadership role sits with the
        <b>Ministry of Transport and Logistics Services (<span lang="AR-SA" dir="RTL">وزارة النقل والخدمات اللوجستية</span>)</b>.<br>
        Website: <a href="https://mot.gov.sa/en/home">https://mot.gov.sa/en/home</a>
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        The ministry’s role is not to manage every project detail directly; it steers the overall system by defining
        priorities, coordinating national programs, and driving integration across modes so the transport and logistics
        sector advances as a coherent whole.
      </p>

      <p class="text-body"><b>What this function does (typical responsibilities):</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sets sector direction and high-level priorities.</li>
        <li>Coordinates cross-mode programs (roads, logistics, aviation, rail, ports) so they align.</li>
        <li>Enables system-level integration and strategic transformation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-body"><b>What this function does not do:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is not the day-to-day regulator of individual service providers.</li>
        <li>It is not traffic enforcement.</li>
        <li>It is not independent accident investigation.</li>
        <li>It is not the detailed designer for every road or intersection.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example-box">
        <span class="box-title">Example</span>
        <p class="text-body">
          A national goal to improve network quality or logistics performance is set at this level, but
        the delivery of projects and services is carried by specialized entities in each mode.

      <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Understand → Apply</span>

      <p class="text-body">
        A transport system needs rules. Regulation is the function that controls who is allowed to provide transport
        services, what requirements those services must meet, and how users and operators are protected. Regulation
        prevents disorder in the market: unlicensed operators, unsafe services, and inconsistent service quality. For
        engineers, regulation matters because it creates the boundaries within which design and operations must work.

        The <b>Transport General Authority (TGA)</b> is the regulator for
        <b>land transport, rail transport, and maritime transport</b> as service sectors. This includes licensing and

        <span class="box-title">Example</span>
        <p class="text-body">
          If a company wants to legally operate a regulated transport service, the permission-to-operate

        The <b>General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA)</b> regulates the aviation sector. Aviation is treated as a

      <p class="text-body">
        A transport system also needs organizations that take responsibility for infrastructure: networks and terminals

      <span class="bloom-level">Required Bloom level for this section: Understand → Apply</span>

      <p class="text-body">
        A transport system needs technical requirements that translate safety and performance expectations into
        consistent engineering decisions. Technical standards exist because designs must be consistent across projects
        to produce predictable outcomes and reduce avoidable risk.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        In Saudi Arabia, technical requirements are especially visible in the road sector through road-sector frameworks

      <p class="text-body">Safety is addressed through more than one function.</p>
      <p class="text-body">
        <b>Safety oversight</b> exists inside regulators and infrastructure owners. It includes safety requirements,

              authority or project owner improves road design and operations; the National Transport Safety Center
