## Question 4 – Human Factors in Transportation (2 marks)
**Bloom's level:** Understand

Why do human factors make transportation engineering more complex and less predictable than many other civil engineering disciplines?

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>

Transportation engineering is more complex because system performance depends on human perception, reaction time, judgment, and compliance, which vary among individuals and situations and cannot be fully controlled.
</details>

## Question 5 – Disciplinary Scope (2 marks)
**Bloom's level:** Understand

Differentiate between transportation engineering and traffic engineering in terms of scope and primary focus.

<details>
<summary><strong>Answer:</strong></summary>

Transportation engineering focuses on system-wide planning, design, and integration across modes, while traffic engineering concentrates on roadway operations such as flow, control, and safety.
</details>
